# Project Reflection

## Project Overview
This project focused on designing a game called *Draw It or Lose It* for a client named The Gaming Room. The game was originally available on Android, and the client wanted to make it work as a web-based game so that people could play on various devices like computers, phones, and tablets. The game involves players trying to guess drawings to earn points, and it allows for team-based competition.

## Key Achievements
The design ensured that the game could run on different devices while keeping everything organized and functional. To prevent multiple versions of the game from running at the same time, the design used the *Singleton Pattern*. This ensures that only one game service operates at any given moment.

Unique names for games and teams were another priority. The design used the *Iterator Pattern* to check for duplicate names, ensuring that each team and game has a unique identity. This helps prevent confusion when creating new games or teams.

## Software Design Document
Creating a design document before building the game was beneficial for planning out how the game would work. It allowed for thinking through all necessary details, such as how to support multiple devices and manage many players at once. This preparation made it easier to explain the gameâ€™s structure to both the client and the development team.

## Areas for Improvement
If changes were to be made, adding more diagrams and visual aids would make the design easier to understand for everyone. Visuals can help show how the different parts of the game fit together. Simplifying the language in the document could also ensure that a wider audience can easily follow the plan.

## Understanding Player Needs
The design focused on making the game user-friendly and fun. Ensuring compatibility with different devices like phones and computers was key, as well as making sure the game remained fair and smooth during play. Considering what players want helps create a more enjoyable game, making it easy for them to engage and have fun.

## Game Design
The design process began by identifying what the game needed to do, such as allowing teams to play against each other and tracking points. After that, each part of the game was planned to ensure that everything worked together seamlessly. This approach helps in staying organized and makes the development process more efficient.
